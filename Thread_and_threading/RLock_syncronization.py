# Allows reentrant lock (the same thread can lock a resources multiple times).
# RLock objects have two functions:
# 1. Python 3: Lock.acquire(blocking=True, timeout=-1) (timeout means how many seconds the Lock has to wait until it is acquired.
# Lock.release() ïƒ¨ decreases the counter. Once it reaches 0, the lock is unlocked

# Within the same thread, be sure that the number of acquire queries is the same as the number  of release (otherwise you risk keeping the lock unlocked
